The major goal is to demonstrate, in a simplified environment, how you can use RL techniques to develop an efficient and safe approach for tackling this problem.\n\nThe Smartcab's job is to pick up the passenger at one location and drop them off in another. Here are a few things that we'd love our Smartcab to take care of:\n\nDrop off the passenger to the right location.\nSave passenger's time by taking minimum time possible to drop off\nTake care of passenger's safety and traffic rules\nThere are different aspects that need to be considered here while modeling an RL solution to this problem: rewards, states, and actions.\n\n1. Rewards\nSince the agent (the imaginary driver) is reward-motivated and is going to learn how to control the cab by trial experiences in the environment, we need to decide the rewards and/or penalties and their magnitude accordingly. Here a few points to consider:\n\nThe agent should receive a high positive reward for a successful dropoff because this behavior is highly desired\nThe agent should be penalized if it tries to drop off a passenger in wrong locations\nThe agent should get a slight negative reward for not making it to the destination after every time-step. \"Slight\" negative because we would prefer our agent to reach late instead of making wrong moves trying to reach to the destination as fast as possible\n2. State Space\nIn Reinforcement Learning, the agent encounters a state, and then takes action according to the state it's in.\n\nThe State Space is the set of all possible situations our taxi could inhabit. The state should contain useful information the agent needs to make the right action.\n\nLet's say we have a training area for our Smartcab where we are teaching it to transport people in a parking lot to four different locations (R, G, Y, B):\n\n+---------+\n|R: | : :G|\n| : | : : |\n| : : : : |\n| | : | : |\n|Y| : |B: |\n+---------+\n\nLet's assume Smartcab is the only vehicle in this parking lot. We can break up the parking lot into a 5x5 grid, which gives us 25 possible taxi locations. These 25 locations are one part of our state space. Notice the current location state of our taxi is coordinate (3, 1).\n\nYou'll also notice there are four (4) locations that we can pick up and drop off a passenger: R, G, Y, B or [(0,0), (0,4), (4,0), (4,3)] in (row, col) coordinates. Our illustrated passenger is in location Y and they wish to go to location R.\n\nWhen we also account for one (1) additional passenger state of being inside the taxi, we can take all combinations of passenger locations and destination locations to come to a total number of states for our taxi environment; there's four (4) destinations and five (4 + 1) passenger locations.\n\nSo, our taxi environment has 5\u00d75\u00d75\u00d74=500 total possible states.\n\nThe agent encounters one of the 500 states and it takes an action. The action in our case can be to move in a direction or decide to pickup/dropoff a passenger.\n\nIn other words, we have six possible actions:\n\nsouth\nnorth\neast\nwest\npickup\ndropoff\n\nThis is the action space: the set of all the actions that our agent can take in a given state.\n\nYou'll notice in the illustration above, that the taxi cannot perform certain actions in certain states due to walls. In environment's code, we will simply provide a -1 penalty for every wall hit and the taxi won't move anywhere. This will just rack up penalties causing the taxi to consider going around the wall.\n\n3. Action Space\nThe agent encounters one of the 500 states and it takes an action. The action in our case can be to move in a direction or decide to pickup/dropoff a passenger.\n\nIn other words, we have six possible actions:\n\nsouth\nnorth\neast\nwest\npickup\ndropoff\n\nThis is the action space: the set of all the actions that our agent can take in a given state.\n\nYou'll notice in the illustration above, that the taxi cannot perform certain actions in certain states due to walls. In environment's code, we will simply provide a -1 penalty for every wall hit and the taxi won't move anywhere. This will just rack up penalties causing the taxi to consider going around the wall.\n\n## Implementation with Python\nFortunately, OpenAI Gym has this exact environment already built for us.\n\nGym provides different game environments which we can plug into our code and test an agent. The library takes care of API for providing all the information that our agent would require, like possible actions, score, and current state. We just need to focus just on the algorithm part for our agent.\n\nWe'll be using the Gym environment called Taxi-V2, which all of the details explained above were pulled from. The objectives, rewards, and actions are all the same.\n\nGym's interface\nWe need to install gym first.

You can play around with the numbers and you'll see the taxi, passenger, and destination move around.\n\n## The Reward Table\nWhen the Taxi environment is created, there is an initial Reward table that's also created, called `P`.

Each successfull dropoff is the end of an episode\nNote that if our agent chose to explore action two (2) in this state it would be going East into a wall. The source code has made it impossible to actually move the taxi across a wall, so if the taxi chooses that action, it will just keep accruing -1 penalties, which affects the long-term reward.\n\n## Solving the environment without Reinforcement Learning\nLet's see what would happen if we try to brute-force our way to solving the problem without RL.\n\nSince we have our P table for default rewards in each state, we can try to have our taxi navigate just using that.\n\nWe'll create an infinite loop which runs until one passenger reaches one destination (one episode), or in other words, when the received reward is 20.

Our agent takes thousands of timesteps and makes lots of wrong drop offs to deliver just one passenger to the right destination.\n\nThis is because we aren't learning from past experience. We can run this over and over, and it will never optimize. The agent has no memory of which action was best for each state, which is exactly what Reinforcement Learning will do for us.\n\n## Enter Reinforcement Learning\nWe are going to use a simple RL algorithm called Q-learning which will give our agent some memory.\n\n### Intro to Q-learning\nEssentially, Q-learning lets the agent use the environment's rewards to learn, over time, the best action to take in a given state.\n\nIn our Taxi environment, we have the reward table, P, that the agent will learn from. It does thing by looking receiving a reward for taking an action in the current state, then updating a Q-value to remember if that action was beneficial.\n\nThe values store in the Q-table are called a Q-values, and they map to a (state, action) combination.\n\nA Q-value for a particular state-action combination is representative of the \"quality\" of an action taken from that state. Better Q-values imply better chances of getting greater rewards.\n\nFor example, if the taxi is faced with a state that includes a passenger at its current location, it is highly likely that the Q-value for pickup is higher when compared to other actions, like dropoff or north.\n\nQ-values are initialized to an arbitrary value, and as the agent exposes itself to the environment and receives different rewards by executing different actions, the Q-values are updated using the equation:\n\nQ(state,action)\u2190(1\u2212\u03b1)Q(state,action)+\u03b1(reward+\u03b3maxaQ(next state,all actions))\nWhere:\n\n- \u03b1 (alpha) is the learning rate (0<\u03b1\u22641) - Just like in supervised learning settings, \u03b1 is the extent to which our Q-values are being updated in every iteration.\n\n- \u03b3 (gamma) is the discount factor (0\u2264\u03b3\u22641) - determines how much importance we want to give to future rewards. A high value for the discount factor (close to 1) captures the long-term effective award, whereas, a discount factor of 0 makes our agent consider only immediate reward, hence making it greedy.\n\n### What is this saying?\n\nWe are assigning (\u2190), or updating, the Q-value of the agent's current state and action by first taking a weight (1\u2212\u03b1) of the old Q-value, then adding the learned value. The learned value is a combination of the reward for taking the current action in the current state, and the discounted maximum reward from the next state we will be in once we take the current action.\n\nBasically, we are learning the proper action to take in the current state by looking at the reward for the current state/action combo, and the max rewards for the next state. This will eventually cause our taxi to consider the route with the best rewards strung together.\n\nThe Q-value of a state-action pair is the sum of the instant reward and the discounted future reward (of the resulting state). The way we store the Q-values for each state and action is through a Q-table\n\nQ-Table\nThe Q-table is a matrix where we have a row for every state (500) and a column for every action (6). It's first initialized to 0, and then values are updated after training. Note that the Q-table has the same dimensions as the reward table, but it has a completely different purpose.\n\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/lds-media/images/q-matrix-initialized-to-learned_gQq0BFs.width-1200.png\" width=\"400\">\n\n## Summing up the Q-Learning Process\nBreaking it down into steps, we get\n\nInitialize the Q-table by all zeros.\nStart exploring actions: For each state, select any one among all possible actions for the current state (S).\nTravel to the next state (S') as a result of that action (a).\nFor all possible actions from the state (S') select the one with the highest Q-value.\nUpdate Q-table values using the equation.\nSet the next state as the current state.\nIf goal state is reached, then end and repeat the process.\nExploiting learned values\nAfter enough random exploration of actions, the Q-values tend to converge serving our agent as an action-value function which it can exploit to pick the most optimal action from a given state.\n\nThere's a tradeoff between exploration (choosing a random action) and exploitation (choosing actions based on already learned Q-values). We want to prevent the action from always taking the same route, and possibly overfitting, so we'll be introducing another parameter called \u03f5 \"epsilon\" to cater to this during training.\n\nInstead of just selecting the best learned Q-value action, we'll sometimes favor exploring the action space further. Lower epsilon value results in episodes with more penalties (on average) which is obvious because we are exploring and making random decisions.\n\n## Implementing Q-learning in python\nTraining the Agent\nFirst, we'll initialize the Q-table to a 500\u00d76 matrix of zeros:"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "import numpy as np\nq_table = np.zeros([env.observation_space.n, env.action_space.n])", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "We can now create the training algorithm that will update this Q-table as the agent explores the environment over thousands of episodes.\n\nIn the first part of while not done, we decide whether to pick a random action or to exploit the already computed Q-values. This is done simply by using the epsilon value and comparing it to the random.uniform(0, 1) function, which returns an arbitrary number between 0 and 1.\n\nWe execute the chosen action in the environment to obtain the next_state and the reward from performing the action. After that, we calculate the maximum Q-value for the actions corresponding to the next_state, and with that, we can easily update our Q-value to the new_q_value:"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "%%time\n\"\"\"Training the agent\"\"\"\n\nimport random\nfrom IPython.display import clear_output\n\n# Hyperparameters\nalpha = 0.1\ngamma = 0.6\nepsilon = 0.1\n\n# For plotting metrics\nall_epochs = []\nall_penalties = []\n\nfor i in range(1, 100001):\n    state = env.reset()\n\n    epochs, penalties, reward, = 0, 0, 0\n    done = False\n    \n    while not done:\n        if random.uniform(0, 1) < epsilon:\n            action = env.action_space.sample() # Explore action space\n        else:\n            action = np.argmax(q_table[state]) # Exploit learned values\n\n        next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action) \n        \n        old_value = q_table[state, action]\n        next_max = np.max(q_table[next_state])\n        \n        new_value = (1 - alpha) * old_value + alpha * (reward + gamma * next_max)\n        q_table[state, action] = new_value\n\n        if reward == -10:\n            penalties += 1\n\n        state = next_state\n        epochs += 1\n        \n    if i % 100 == 0:\n        clear_output(wait=True)\n        print(f\"Episode: {i}\")\n\nprint(\"Training finished.\\n\")", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Now that the Q-table has been established over 100,000 episodes, let's see what the Q-values are at our illustration's state:"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "q_table[328]\n", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "The max Q-value is \"north\" (-1.971), so it looks like Q-learning has effectively learned the best action to take in our illustration's state!\n\n### Evaluating the agent\nLet's evaluate the performance of our agent.

Let's see how much better our Q-learning solution is when compared to the agent making just random moves.\n\nWe evaluate our agents according to the following metrics,\n\nAverage number of penalties per episode: The smaller the number, the better the performance of our agent. Ideally, we would like this metric to be zero or very close to zero.\nAverage number of timesteps per trip: We want a small number of timesteps per episode as well since we want our agent to take minimum steps(i.e. the shortest path) to reach the destination.\nAverage rewards per move: The larger the reward means the agent is doing the right thing. That's why deciding rewards is a crucial part of Reinforcement Learning. In our case, as both timesteps and penalties are negatively rewarded, a higher average reward would mean that the agent reaches the destination as fast as possible with the least penalties\"\n\nAverage rewards per move : \n    Random agent's performance - -3.9012092102214075\n    Q-learning agent's performance - 0.6962843295638126\n\nAverage number of penalties per episode :\n    Random agent's performance - 920.45\n    Q-learning agent's performance - 0.0\n\nAverage number of timesteps per trip :\n    Random agent's performance - 2848.14\n    Q-learning agent's performance - 12.38\n    \nThese metrics were computed over 100 episodes. And as the results show, our Q-learning agent nailed it!\n\n### Hyperparameters and optimizations\nThe values of `alpha`, `gamma`, and `epsilon` were mostly based on intuition and some \"hit and trial\", but there are better ways to come up with good values.\n\nIdeally, all three should decrease over time because as the agent continues to learn, it actually builds up more resilient priors;\n\n\u03b1: (the learning rate) should decrease as you continue to gain a larger and larger knowledge base.\n\u03b3: as you get closer and closer to the deadline, your preference for near-term reward should increase, as you won't be around long enough to get the long-term reward, which means your gamma should decrease.\n\u03f5: as we develop our strategy, we have less need of exploration and more exploitation to get more utility from our policy, so as trials increase, epsilon should decrease.\nTuning the hyperparameters\nA simple way to programmatically come up with the best set of values of the hyperparameter is to create a comprehensive search function (similar to grid search) that selects the parameters that would result in best reward/time_steps ratio. The reason for reward/time_steps is that we want to choose parameters which enable us to get the maximum reward as fast as possible. We may want to track the number of penalties corresponding to the hyperparameter value combination as well because this can also be a deciding factor (we don't want our smart agent to violate rules at the cost of reaching faster). A more fancy way to get the right combination of hyperparameter values would be to use Genetic Algorithms.\n\n## Conclusion and What's Ahead\nAlright! We began with understanding Reinforcement Learning with the help of real-world analogies. We then dived into the basics of Reinforcement Learning and framed a Self-driving cab as a Reinforcement Learning problem. We then used OpenAI's Gym in python to provide us with a related environment, where we can develop our agent and evaluate it. Then we observed how terrible our agent was without using any algorithm to play the game, so we went ahead to implement the Q-learning algorithm from scratch. The agent's performance improved significantly after Q-learning. Finally, we discussed better approaches for deciding the hyperparameters for our algorithm.\n\nQ-learning is one of the easiest Reinforcement Learning algorithms. The problem with Q-earning however is, once the number of states in the environment are very high, it becomes difficult to implement them with Q table as the size would become very, very large. State of the art techniques uses Deep neural networks instead of the Q-table (Deep Reinforcement Learning). The neural network takes in state information and actions to the input layer and learns to output the right action over the time. Deep learning techniques (like Convolutional Neural Networks) are also used to interpret the pixels on the screen and extract information out of the game (like scores), and then letting the agent control the game.\n\nWe have discussed a lot about Reinforcement Learning and games. But Reinforcement learning is not just limited to games. It is used for managing stock portfolios and finances, for making humanoid robots, for manufacturing and inventory management, to develop general AI agents, which are agents that can perform multiple things with a single algorithm, like the same agent playing multiple Atari games. Open AI also has a platform called universe for measuring and training an AI's general intelligence across myriads of games, websites and other general applications."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Reference: https://www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/reinforcement-q-learning-scratch-python-openai-gym/"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
