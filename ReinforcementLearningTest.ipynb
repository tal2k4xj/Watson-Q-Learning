    "## Example Design: Self-Driving Cab\n",
    "Let's design a simulation of a self-driving cab. The major goal is to demonstrate, in a simplified environment, how you can use RL techniques to develop an efficient and safe approach for tackling this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Smartcab's job is to pick up the passenger at one location and drop them off in another. Here are a few things that we'd love our Smartcab to take care of:\n",
    "\n",
    "Drop off the passenger to the right location.\n",
    "Save passenger's time by taking minimum time possible to drop off\n",
    "Take care of passenger's safety and traffic rules\n",
    "There are different aspects that need to be considered here while modeling an RL solution to this problem: rewards, states, and actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rewards\n",
    "Since the agent (the imaginary driver) is reward-motivated and is going to learn how to control the cab by trial experiences in the environment, we need to decide the rewards and/or penalties and their magnitude accordingly. Here a few points to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent should receive a high positive reward for a successful dropoff because this behavior is highly desired\n",
    "The agent should be penalized if it tries to drop off a passenger in wrong locations\n",
    "The agent should get a slight negative reward for not making it to the destination after every time-step. \"Slight\" negative because we would prefer our agent to reach late instead of making wrong moves trying to reach to the destination as fast as possible\n",
    "2. State Space\n",
    "In Reinforcement Learning, the agent encounters a state, and then takes action according to the state it's in.\n",
    "\n",
    "The State Space is the set of all possible situations our taxi could inhabit. The state should contain useful information the agent needs to make the right action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a training area for our Smartcab where we are teaching it to transport people in a parking lot to four different locations (R, G, Y, B):\n",
    "\n",
    "+---------+\n",
    "|R: | : :G|\n",
    "| : | : : |\n",
    "| : : : : |\n",
    "| | : | : |\n",
    "|Y| : |B: |\n",
    "+---------+\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume Smartcab is the only vehicle in this parking lot. We can break up the parking lot into a 5x5 grid, which gives us 25 possible taxi locations. These 25 locations are one part of our state space. Notice the current location state of our taxi is coordinate (3, 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also notice there are four (4) locations that we can pick up and drop off a passenger: R, G, Y, B or [(0,0), (0,4), (4,0), (4,3)] in (row, col) coordinates. Our illustrated passenger is in location Y and they wish to go to location R.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we also account for one (1) additional passenger state of being inside the taxi, we can take all combinations of passenger locations and destination locations to come to a total number of states for our taxi environment; there's four (4) destinations and five (4 + 1) passenger locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, our taxi environment has 5×5×5×4=500 total possible states.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent encounters one of the 500 states and it takes an action. The action in our case can be to move in a direction or decide to pickup/dropoff a passenger.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we have six possible actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "south\n",
    "north\n",
    "east\n",
    "west\n",
    "pickup\n",
    "dropoff\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the action space: the set of all the actions that our agent can take in a given state.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice in the illustration above, that the taxi cannot perform certain actions in certain states due to walls. In environment's code, we will simply provide a -1 penalty for every wall hit and the taxi won't move anywhere. This will just rack up penalties causing the taxi to consider going around the wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Action Space\n",
    "The agent encounters one of the 500 states and it takes an action. The action in our case can be to move in a direction or decide to pickup/dropoff a passenger.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we have six possible actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "south\n",
    "north\n",
    "east\n",
    "west\n",
    "pickup\n",
    "dropoff\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the action space: the set of all the actions that our agent can take in a given state.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice in the illustration above, that the taxi cannot perform certain actions in certain states due to walls. In environment's code, we will simply provide a -1 penalty for every wall hit and the taxi won't move anywhere. This will just rack up penalties causing the taxi to consider going around the wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation with Python\n",
    "Fortunately, OpenAI Gym has this exact environment already built for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gym provides different game environments which we can plug into our code and test an agent. The library takes care of API for providing all the information that our agent would require, like possible actions, score, and current state. We just need to focus just on the algorithm part for our agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using the Gym environment called Taxi-V2, which all of the details explained above were pulled from. The objectives, rewards, and actions are all the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gym's interface\n",
    "We need to install gym first. Executing the following in a Jupyter notebook should work:"

    "Not good. Our agent takes thousands of timesteps and makes lots of wrong drop offs to deliver just one passenger to the right destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because we aren't learning from past experience. We can run this over and over, and it will never optimize. The agent has no memory of which action was best for each state, which is exactly what Reinforcement Learning will do for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Enter Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "We are going to use a simple RL algorithm called Q-learning which will give our agent some memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intro to Q-learning\n",
    "Essentially, Q-learning lets the agent use the environment's rewards to learn, over time, the best action to take in a given state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our Taxi environment, we have the reward table, P, that the agent will learn from. It does thing by looking receiving a reward for taking an action in the current state, then updating a Q-value to remember if that action was beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The values store in the Q-table are called a Q-values, and they map to a (state, action) combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Q-value for a particular state-action combination is representative of the \"quality\" of an action taken from that state. Better Q-values imply better chances of getting greater rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the taxi is faced with a state that includes a passenger at its current location, it is highly likely that the Q-value for pickup is higher when compared to other actions, like dropoff or north.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-values are initialized to an arbitrary value, and as the agent exposes itself to the environment and receives different rewards by executing different actions, the Q-values are updated using the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Q(state,action)←(1−α)Q(state,action)+α(reward+γmaxaQ(next state,all actions))\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- α (alpha) is the learning rate (0<α≤1) - Just like in supervised learning settings, α is the extent to which our Q-values are being updated in every iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- γ (gamma) is the discount factor (0≤γ≤1) - determines how much importance we want to give to future rewards. A high value for the discount factor (close to 1) captures the long-term effective award, whereas, a discount factor of 0 makes our agent consider only immediate reward, hence making it greedy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is this saying?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are assigning (←), or updating, the Q-value of the agent's current state and action by first taking a weight (1−α) of the old Q-value, then adding the learned value. The learned value is a combination of the reward for taking the current action in the current state, and the discounted maximum reward from the next state we will be in once we take the current action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, we are learning the proper action to take in the current state by looking at the reward for the current state/action combo, and the max rewards for the next state. This will eventually cause our taxi to consider the route with the best rewards strung together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Q-value of a state-action pair is the sum of the instant reward and the discounted future reward (of the resulting state). The way we store the Q-values for each state and action is through a Q-table\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-Table\n",
    "The Q-table is a matrix where we have a row for every state (500) and a column for every action (6). It's first initialized to 0, and then values are updated after training. Note that the Q-table has the same dimensions as the reward table, but it has a completely different purpose.\n",

    "If goal state is reached, then end and repeat the process.\n",
    "Exploiting learned values\n",
    "After enough random exploration of actions, the Q-values tend to converge serving our agent as an action-value function which it can exploit to pick the most optimal action from a given state.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a tradeoff between exploration (choosing a random action) and exploitation (choosing actions based on already learned Q-values). We want to prevent the action from always taking the same route, and possibly overfitting, so we'll be introducing another parameter called ϵ \"epsilon\" to cater to this during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of just selecting the best learned Q-value action, we'll sometimes favor exploring the action space further. Lower epsilon value results in episodes with more penalties (on average) which is obvious because we are exploring and making random decisions.\n",

    "Ideally, all three should decrease over time because as the agent continues to learn, it actually builds up more resilient priors;\n",
    "\n",
    "α: (the learning rate) should decrease as you continue to gain a larger and larger knowledge base.\n",
    "γ: as you get closer and closer to the deadline, your preference for near-term reward should increase, as you won't be around long enough to get the long-term reward, which means your gamma should decrease.\n",
    "ϵ: as we develop our strategy, we have less need of exploration and more exploitation to get more utility from our policy, so as trials increase, epsilon should decrease.\n",
    "Tuning the hyperparameters\n",
    "A simple way to programmatically come up with the best set of values of the hyperparameter is to create a comprehensive search function (similar to grid search) that selects the parameters that would result in best reward/time_steps ratio. The reason for reward/time_steps is that we want to choose parameters which enable us to get the maximum reward as fast as possible. We may want to track the number of penalties corresponding to the hyperparameter value combination as well because this can also be a deciding factor (we don't want our smart agent to violate rules at the cost of reaching faster). A more fancy way to get the right combination of hyperparameter values would be to use Genetic Algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion and What's Ahead\n",
    "Alright! We began with understanding Reinforcement Learning with the help of real-world analogies. We then dived into the basics of Reinforcement Learning and framed a Self-driving cab as a Reinforcement Learning problem. We then used OpenAI's Gym in python to provide us with a related environment, where we can develop our agent and evaluate it. Then we observed how terrible our agent was without using any algorithm to play the game, so we went ahead to implement the Q-learning algorithm from scratch. The agent's performance improved significantly after Q-learning. Finally, we discussed better approaches for deciding the hyperparameters for our algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-learning is one of the easiest Reinforcement Learning algorithms. The problem with Q-earning however is, once the number of states in the environment are very high, it becomes difficult to implement them with Q table as the size would become very, very large. State of the art techniques uses Deep neural networks instead of the Q-table (Deep Reinforcement Learning). The neural network takes in state information and actions to the input layer and learns to output the right action over the time. Deep learning techniques (like Convolutional Neural Networks) are also used to interpret the pixels on the screen and extract information out of the game (like scores), and then letting the agent control the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have discussed a lot about Reinforcement Learning and games. But Reinforcement learning is not just limited to games. It is used for managing stock portfolios and finances, for making humanoid robots, for manufacturing and inventory management, to develop general AI agents, which are agents that can perform multiple things with a single algorithm, like the same agent playing multiple Atari games. Open AI also has a platform called universe for measuring and training an AI's general intelligence across myriads of games, websites and other general applications."
